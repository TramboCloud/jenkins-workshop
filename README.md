# JENKINS WORKSHOP

This repository is used in the course From Dev to DevOps, and it contains files that will bring up a jenkins server using a dockerfile and docker-compose.


## Setting up

As the instructor showed you in the course, in order to run the jenkins server you need to execute

````
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
````

After that you need to wait a couple minutes while all the configurations are created.
